### Instructions
**Run index.html in your web browser.**  
*Untested in Internet Explorer! Also, the game uses Google Fonts with @import statements, so some fonts may not look as intended if you have no internet connection.*

### Directories & Files
* **index.html** — The game.
* **lib/** — Contains the jQuery & jQuery UI libraries
* **src/** — The game's source files, including:
  - script.js — The JavaScript logic which controlls gameplay.
  - style.css — The CSS markup for game styling.
* **img/** — Images used in the game (as backgrounds), these files are quite large, and probably wouldn't be used in a production environment, but hey they were pretty! :)
